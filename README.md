# EverdriveFont
This is a repo I made for easy access to the BPS patches I make for custom Everdrive fonts. At first it was just for the Everdrive-GB, but now it's intended for all of the Everdrives without theme support.
More fonts may be added as time goes on. Most fonts are extended and/or edited by me unless otherwise stated.
